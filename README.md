# Local Services 

## Background

This is an experiment of an idea to run common services to run as independent Docker containers instead of being included as a "service" in a containerized app's `compose.yaml`. These services may include, but are not limited to, (1) Postgres server, (2) Redis/ValKey server, (3) MQTT server, etc.

This idea came about because I wanted to try out [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) -- an Open Source Identity and Access Management tool -- as the IAM solution for signing in to web applications during development in my local machine. Since Keycloak uses the Postgres database, I wanted to try if I can run one Keycloak container, one Postgres container, and multiple web applications to connect to both services. Thus the idea for `local-services`.

I also thought that this would simulate a real-world setup where only one instance of Keycloak setup to handle all the IAM for the different web applications thus enabling single sign-on to all the applications.

## Understanding

This is how I envisioned it on my mind. I don't know if this is a feasible setup, but that's the reason for this experimentation.

    subgraph APP2["App 2"]
        direction LR
        FE2["front-end"]
        BE2["back-end"]
  
        FE2 <--> BE2
     end

    subgraph APP1["App 1"]
        direction LR
        FE1["front-end"]
        BE1["back-end"]
  
        FE1 <--> BE1
     end

    BE1 <--> PSQL
    BE2 <--> PSQL

    KCLK <--> BE1
    KCLK <--> BE2
    KCLK <--> PSQL
```

## Implementation

This experiment will utilize Docker tools and containerization technologies. For local development, it will employ the Docker Desktop application and the Docker Compose tool.

Here are some other tools and applications that I am considering of using (as of Apr 2025) for this experiment:

1. PostgreSQL
2. Keycloak

## Lesson(s) Learned

TBD

## Deliverables

* A Docker Compose file for the services involved in this experiment
